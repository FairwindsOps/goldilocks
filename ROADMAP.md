# goldilocks Roadmap

Most of the future roadmap of this project will be to improve the quality of the code, as well as the usability of the dashboard.  The basic functionality is simple: provide resource recommendation aggregation.

## Potential Future Work

* Much better unit testing. See #5
* Container name exclusion.  See #7
* Deployment reconciliation - Allow the labelling of deployments instead of just namespaces
* Deployment - be able to deploy VPA, prometheus, and goldilocks with Helm.
