# goldilocks Roadmap

Most of the future roadmap of this project will be to improve the quality of the code, as well as the usability of the dashboard.  The basic functionality is simple: provide resource recommendation aggregation.

## Potential Future Work

* Much better unit testing.  Get over 80%.  See #5
* Container name exclusion.  See #7
* Deployment reconciliation - Allow the labelling of deployments instead of just namespaces
* Dashboard improvement - Show current resource request/limit and how close it is to the recommendation.
